# Move Programming Language

Move is a resource-oriented programming language designed specifically for secure management of digital assets on blockchain. Learn how Move's revolutionary approach eliminates entire classes of vulnerabilities through its unique resource model.

:::tip Prerequisites for Move Development
Before diving into Move programming, ensure you have:
- ✅ [Installed Rust and Node.js](/getting-started/libs) - Required for the development toolchain
- ✅ [Installed the Cedra CLI](/getting-started/cli) - Essential for compiling and deploying Move modules
