# Build a DEX on Cedra - Complete Guide

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for building a decentralized exchange (DEX) on Cedra. This six-part series will take you from understanding the fundamentals to deploying a production-ready DEX with advanced features.

---

## What You'll Build

By the end of this guide, you'll have created a production-ready DEX featuring:
- **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** pools with constant product formula (x*y=k)
- **Multi-token trading pairs** with automatic price discovery
- **Advanced price protection** including slippage tolerance and price impact limits
- **Multi-hop routing** for optimal trade execution across pools
- **Complete TypeScript client** with React integration

### [1. Understanding Automated Market Makers](./dex/understanding-amm)
Deep dive into AMM mechanics, constant product formulas, liquidity provision, and impermanent loss.

### [2. Building Your First Trading Pair](./dex/first-trading-pair)
Hands-on implementation of a basic trading pair with swap, add liquidity, and remove liquidity functions.

### [3. Adding Price Protection Mechanisms](./dex/price-protection)
Implement slippage protection, minimum output amounts, and deadline checks to protect users.

### [4. Multi-hop Routing for Optimal Execution](./dex/multi-hop-routing)
Build a router that finds the best path through multiple pools for optimal trade execution.

### [5. DEX Client Integration Guide](./dex/client-integration)
Create a TypeScript/React frontend that interacts with your DEX smart contracts.
