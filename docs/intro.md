# Cedra Documentation

Cedra is a next-generation, public-good blockchain that reimagines how infrastructure is built, funded, and governed in the Move ecosystem. Cedra extends the Move resource model with custom modules that make network composition a first-class feature: any team can deploy a fully fledged sub-network—complete with its own gas economics, validator set, and governance—using familiar Move tooling and CLI workflows.

### Architectural Highlights

- **Block-STM parallel execution** – Adapted from the Diem research lineage, Block-STM dynamically detects transaction conflicts and executes non-overlapping smart-contract calls in parallel. This yields massive throughput on commodity hardware while remaining 100 % deterministic, so even archival nodes can verify blocks independently.  
- **Modular network topology** – Instead of sharding for scale alone, Cedra treats “networks-within-the-network” as a product feature. Builders can carve out dedicated spaces for gaming, DeFi, or enterprise use cases without fragmenting liquidity or security.  
- **Fair-launch tokenomics** – The CED token debuted with no VC presale, no premine, and transparent on-chain distribution schedules. Staking and validator rewards funnel value directly to the people who keep the chain alive.  

### Governance & Incentives

Cedra practices **proof-of-collaboration**: proposals originate in public discussion, mature in open GitHub repos, and are finalized through on-chain voting. Validators are run by the community, and delegation is frictionless, so influence tracks real contribution rather than capital concentration. Grants from the Cedra Foundation target tooling, documentation, and real-world products, accelerating time-to-mainnet for new teams.

### Developer Experience

Move’s strong static typing, asset-safety guarantees, and Rust-like syntax lower the cognitive load for Web3 builders. Cedra layers on pre-audited templates, funding guides, and hackathon starter kits that turn “Hello, Move” projects into production dApps in days, not months. With EVM-adjacent bridges, developers can tap existing liquidity while enjoying Move’s resource-based security model.

### Culture & Values

Cedra champions **builder sovereignty, fairness, open collaboration, rapid iteration,** and a playful, meme-infused community spirit. The emotional promise is one of trust, confidence, support, and belonging: if you contribute, you matter—and you share in the upside.

By aligning high-performance tech with radically open governance, Cedra positions itself as the foundation on which the next wave of community-owned economies will run—whether that’s tokenizing Europe, the world, or ideas we haven’t imagined yet.
