# Getting Started with Cedra

### 1. 🛠️ Install CLI
Start by installing the Cedra Command Line Interface, which is essential for all development activities.

[**CLI Installation Guide →**](/docs/getting-started/cli)

### 2. 🔧 Set Up IDE Extension
Install Move language support for your preferred IDE to get syntax highlighting, code completion, and error detection.

**For VSCode:**
- Install the [Move Language Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MoveBit.aptos-move-analyzer) from the marketplace

**For JetBrains IDEs:**
- Install the [Move Language Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14721-move-on-aptos) for IntelliJ IDEA, CLion, or other JetBrains IDEs

### 3. 🚀 Initialize Your First Project

```bash
cedra move init --name first_smart_contract
```

This command creates a new Move project with the basic structure needed for smart contract development.
